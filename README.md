## Technologies

1. NextJS + ExpressJS API + mongoDB for Vercel
2. ReactJS
3. AntDesign

## Current issues

1. DB init is too long --> vercel time out
2. cannot router.path to update a user

## To run locally

1. In Dashboard.js replace all PROD_HOST --> LOCAL_HOST

## More information

1. Stop using localStorage to store liked, passed - It worked so I upgrade to use back-end and I got those 2 issues

## Lesson

1. Express + Vercel + MongoDB is not a really combo in my opinion - change my mind --> open a PR?
2. Should have used heroku --> their time out is much longer?

## Technologies

1. NextJS + ExpressJS API + mongoDB for Vercel
2. ReactJS
3. AntDesign

## Current issues

1. DB init is too long --> vercel time out
2. cannot router.path to update a user
3. Mongoose can only be called inside pages/api?

## Lesson

1. Express + Vercel + MongoDB is not a really combo in my opinion - change my mind --> open a PR?
2. Should have used heroku --> their time out is much longer?
